<h3>The Complete Stories by Clarice Lispector</h3>

<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>The Complete Stories is a collection of eighty-four stories curated over Lispector's life. The language created by Lispector within her novels conscious stream of tangents and peculiar compositions that often break the 'rules' of writing but make up for greater storytelling. An intimate understanding is created between the reader and the protagonist of each short story as their private lives are read about through Lispector's lens. Some of these stories emphasize a feminist approach to confront the roles women face in a patriarchal society while others combat themes of absolute absurdity in terror and chaos. All of these stories carry a deeper meaning of existentialism and creating purpose through reflection. My favorite among these stories is 'Silence' as the notion of silence and its eerie confrontations of truth are explored. </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/5LdPKdS/IMG-7467.jpg" alt="An Apprenticeship or the Book of Pleasures by Clarice Lispector." height="275" width="200">
<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>An Apprenticeship or the Book of Pleasures explores the idea of what it means to love and be loved. Ulisses, a professor of philosophy, mentors Lori, a school teacher. The passionate dialogue between these cave their own personal, internal dialogues to confront a greater discovery about themselves toward enlightenment and existential truths. Lispector's writing resonates with the reader from her ability to capture the profound within the ordinary whim of life itself. Although this story centers around the romantic connection of Lori and Ulisses, more meaning is produced regarding the metaphysical dialogue within Lori as she explores herself as an individual. Lori avoids Ulisses because "intimacy becomes cruel when it excludes the possibility of discovery." This retreat allows Lori to explore herself which opens the door to identify what true intimacy means.  </p>

<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>Public Library and Other Stories is not just a short story collection about libraries. It carries a powerful voice within its stories. A voice of literary activism and the power books hold in all their forms. Artful connections between how books shape the discourse of our lives and how libraries have played an essential role that is often taken for granted. </p>

<h3>Selected Poems by Fernando Pessoa</h3>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/3SFSCSw/IMG-7473.jpg" alt="Selected Poems by Fernando Pessoa." height="275" width="200">
<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p> Pessoa's ability to discern several fully formed yet strongly distintive voices through the mind of one poet is astounding. Simplicity in its prose yet full of depth and obscureness.  </p>

<h3>Writers & Lovers by Lily King</h3>
<img src= "https://i.ibb.co/kxBWFxs/IMG-7475.jpg" alt="Writers and lovers by Lily King." height="275" width="200">
<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p> During the summer of 1997, 30-something-year-old Casey Peabody is determined to live the creative life of being a writer. Working as a waitress and paying off outstanding debts, grief and irresolution consume Casey as she transitions to a new period of her life. King writes with humor, tenderness, and the ill familiarity to exist in a time of barely getting by. To be truthful, there is no plot in this book which has led to frustration among many readers of Lily King. For this very reason, Writers & Lovers is a favorite. To follow the life of a protagonist through its mundane actuality as opposed to one immoderate, abstract plot is refreshing. </p>

<h3>Franny and Zooey by J.D. Salinger</h3>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/jW4Cw4k/IMG-7468.jpg" alt="Franny and Zooey by J.D. Salinger." height="275" width="200">
<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p> Franny and Zooey captures the unkempt reality of early adulthood when identities reek of uncertainty and chaos. In the first section, the reader is introduced to Franny, who is visiting her boyfriend, Lane during a weekend of the Yale game. The couple converse at a diner and the dialogue is the main essence of the section. Similar to J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, this novel touches deeply upon the facades of ego and phoniness. The second section touches upon the story of her brother, Zooey which divulges deeply upon religious and philosophical themes. Although there is no progression within both sections, the dialogues creates comical readability while somehow touching upon dark themes. </p>

<h3>Violet Bent Over Backwards Over the Grass by Lana Del Rey</h3>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hmp2jCY/IMG-7464.jpg" alt="Violent Bent Over Backwards Over the Grass by Lana Del Rey." height="275" width="200">
<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>How can poetry be so faltering and dreamy at the same time? It is easy to become consumed by the exuberant and tranquil imagery Lana creates through her words. It is not about the quality of the poems regarding its imperfect and inconsistent rhymes. It is Lana's perfomance emphasizing a haunting vulnerability in self-examination and reflection. 'Salamander' is among my favorites. </p>

<h3>The Stranger by Albert Camus</h3>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/3RKMWYP/IMG-7472.jpg" alt="The Stranger by Albert Camus." height="275" width="200">
<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>Based upon Camus' philosophy of the absurd and existentialism, Camus narrates The Stranger using the same ideologies through storytelling. The reader is introduced to Meursault, who is a 'stranger' to himself and those around him. The Stranger confronts alienation and apathy through Meursault as a character which allows the reader to raise questions of meaninglessness and the absurdity of human life. </p>
