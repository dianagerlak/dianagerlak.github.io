<h3>Selected Poems by Fernando Pessoa</h3>

<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p> Pessoa's ability to discern several fully formed yet strongly distintive voices through the mind of one poet is astounding. Simplicity in its prose yet full of depth and obscureness.  </p>

<h3>Writers & Lovers by Lily King</h3>
<img src= "https://i.ibb.co/kxBWFxs/IMG-7475.jpg" alt="Writers and lovers by Lily King." height="275" width="200">
<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p> During the summer of 1997, 30-something-year-old Casey Peabody is determined to live the creative life of being a writer. Working as a waitress and paying off outstanding debts, grief and irresolution consume Casey as she transitions to a new period of her life. King writes with humor, tenderness, and the ill familiarity to exist in a time of barely getting by. To be truthful, there is no plot in this book which has led to frustration among many readers of Lily King. For this very reason, Writers & Lovers is a favorite. To follow the life of a protagonist through its mundane actuality as opposed to one immoderate, abstract plot is refreshing. </p>

<p> Franny and Zooey captures the unkempt reality of early adulthood when identities reek of uncertainty and chaos. </p>

<h3>Violet Bent Over Backwards Over the Grass by Lana Del Rey</h3>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hmp2jCY/IMG-7464.jpg" alt="Violent Bent Over Backwards Over the Grass by Lana Del Rey." height="275" width="200">
<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>How can poetry be so faltering and dreamy at the same time? It is easy to become consumed by the exuberant and tranquil imagery Lana creates through her words. It is not about the quality of the poems regarding its imperfect and inconsistent rhymes. It is Lana's perfomance emphasizing a haunting vulnerability in self-examination and reflection. 'Salamander' is among my favorites. </p>

<h3>Public Library and Other Stories by Ali Smith</h3>

<p>☆☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>Public Library and Other Stories is not just a short story collection about libraries. It carries a powerful voice within its stories. A voice of literary activism and the power books hold in all their forms. Artful connections between how books shape the discourse of our lives and how libraries have played an essential role that is often taken for granted. </p>
